{text}

An opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or conclusion that goes beyond just stating facts. It represents a formed perspective or belief.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT extract statements like:
- "I don't have enough information"
- "The facts don't contain information about X"
- "I cannot answer because..."
- Simple acknowledgments or meta-statements about the query itself

ONLY extract actual opinions, judgments, or perspectives about substantive topics.

For each opinion found, provide:
1. The opinion itself (what the agent believes or concludes)
2. The reasons or facts that support it
3. A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how confident the agent is in this opinion

If no genuine opinions are expressed (e.g., the response just says "I don't know"), return an empty list."""
